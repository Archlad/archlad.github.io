    <td>I focussed on my own work exceptionally well and did not need help from anyone else. We were tasked to make a picture using google sheets which was quite easy  as you had to use squares to make the image. But my image was a the first letter of my name which is an A. We had to make it by colouring in the boxes in different colours to form an image. I only used two colours which were blue and white. I used blue as the background and white for the letter A.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was finding out the amount of bytes used, the amount of pixels used and most importantly the compressed percentage. This was difficult and I was not exactly sure what to do, so I had to ask the teacher what to do. At first I was not sure what to do, nevertheless I soon figured it out via trial and error. The compressed percentage means the ratio between the two colours. The size of my image was 23 x 16, therefore the amount of bytes is 182, the amount of pixels is 368 and the compressed percentage was 49%.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, when I don't understand what the teacher means, I should ask again to stop wasting time. Also when we stitched around to do the other person’s work, I should not mess around as I wasted a lot of time messing time instead of completing the very easy task of just mapping out their images by using the given 'coordinates’ of the colours which were used. </td>
