    <td>In the last couple of weeks we have been learning to coding on google sheets. Our aim was to make a code for every letter in the alphabet making our own working code. The objective was that if we typed a letter next to it the coded version appears automatically. We had to write a keyword and the alphabet after missing out the letters in the keyword. We put it vertically parallel to the real alphabet  We used a function called VLOOKUP which translates the letters if we code it properly. It was very fun but was quite hard.</td>

    <td>At the start I found it quite hard and did not fully understand how to use the function VLOOKUP, however after a while after I did it repeatedly I started to understand it more. I also got distracted very easily and that did not help me and it limited my learning. </td>
