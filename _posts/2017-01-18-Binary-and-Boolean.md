    <td>Mr Keen, our teacher, explained binary to us by writing numerous questions on the board and making us solve it. It helped me to learn because Mr Keen made challenging questions which took us time to figure out. Computers function on binary therefore it is necessary to understand and know how to use binary in IT. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that the only thing that limited my learning was the limited amount of questions he put up on the board. This is because many people finished early so had not much to do afterwards.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to finish the questions earlier so I could try and help people who find it difficult or do not understand.</td>
