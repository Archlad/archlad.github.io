    <td>This week in I.T we were learning about never giving up and that we should always try our best. We were watching a video, about a Japanese boy trying to jump over a gymnastic apparatus. He attempted the jump many times but failed every time. Every time, he cried and cried, but his teacher made him go back to the starting point and attempt the jump again and again until he succeeded. If we had, which I'm everyone has done in their life, we had to be honest about it and actually learn something from this lesson and take away many important tips.</td>

    <td>Next time I will make sure that I pay more attention to what the teacher says.</td>
