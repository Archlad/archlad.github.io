In today's IT lesson, we carried on with CodeCademy. Some people didn't have tables on their blogs, so that's what they had to fix while we were coding! In this lesson there wasn't much talking being done by Mr Keen- we just got on with the task by ourselves, asking our friends for help if we needed it.
