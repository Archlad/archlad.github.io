    <td>I liked working on my own, so I had got stuck I could just persevere and figure it out myself. I liked the questions Mr Keen had asked us, instead of just telling us how to do it, he gave us questions to try based on the previous knowledge. This helped to develop my understanding of the topic, giving questions after an explanation is a good strategy and is very effective. This is why I fully understand the topic.</td>

    <td>Nothing limited my learning, the lesson was very efficient and I worked in a very productive method. The only times I talked was to check my answers with my neighbouring partners to see if we were both right.  </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>There is not much I would improve for next time. However at the beginning I was not sure how to do hexadecimal, my only point is that I should have asked Mr Keen on the spot to repeat, instead of wasting the first few minutes trying t figure it out whilst I could have been figuring out the given questions.</td>
